Sample application: Factory blinkup fixture (factory imp to imp card)

Author: Aron

Date: 11th August, 2014

This example code is for blessing devices in a factory using a factory blinkup fixture.
For this example:
- the factory blinkup fixture is a factory imp in an April board
  mounted on an enclosure with an LED on pin9. Every 10 seconds the factory blinkup fixture
  will start the blinkup procedure automatically.
- the target device will automatically and immediately be blessed as soon as it runs this code
- the LED on the device's imp card (not the factory blinkup fixure) will turn solid green 
  indicating pass/bless or turn solid red indicating fail/no blessing
- the webhooks will then be notified of the blessing event and take further actions
========================================================================================== */


const SSID = "yourSSID"; 
const PASSWORD = "yourWifiPW"; 
const FIXTURE_MAC = "0c2a690xxxxx";  // NOTE this format of this value

device_id <- hardware.getdeviceid(); 

function factoryblinkup() {
    imp.wakeup(10, factoryblinkup);
    server.factoryblinkup(SSID, PASSWORD, hardware.pin9, BLINKUP_ACTIVEHIGH); 
}

function factorybless() {
    server.bless(true, function(bless_success) { 
        server.log("Blessing " + (bless_success ? "PASSED" : "FAILED")); 
        agent.send("testresult", {device_id = device_id, mac = mac, success = bless_success});
        if (bless_success) imp.clearconfiguration();
    }); 
}
